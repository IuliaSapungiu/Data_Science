### Project Overview

This Python project automates the process of extracting product data from an e-commerce website, organizing it into a structured format, and visualizing the results. 
Using web scraping techniques powered by Selenium, it retrieves product names and prices from a given webpage. 
The project includes an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the data seamlessly.
